Read Flow Spark
A project to efficiently read, process, and transform data using Apache Spark. This repository demonstrates how to integrate data flows with Apache Spark's powerful distributed processing capabilities.

🚀 Overview
This repository provides an implementation for reading and processing large datasets using Apache Spark. The goal is to show how to handle data ingestion, transformation, and writing output with the ease of Spark's API, enabling scalable and performant data pipelines.

🛠 Features
🔄 Seamless data reading from various formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.)

📊 Data transformations using Spark's DataFrame API

🚀 Optimized data flow for large-scale datasets

📝 Output writing to different destinations (e.g., HDFS, local storage, S3)

🧪 Example scripts for real-world Spark use cases

📦 Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed:

Java 8 or above

Apache Spark (preferably 3.x+)

Hadoop (if reading/writing from HDFS or other distributed file systems)

Python (optional, if using PySpark)
